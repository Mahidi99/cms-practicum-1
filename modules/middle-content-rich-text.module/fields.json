Played both recreationally and competitively across the world, it is known for its quick reflexes, intense rallies, and feather-light shuttlecock. Whether played in singles or doubles format, the objective is simpleâ€”outplay your opponent by sending the shuttlecock over the net and into their court in a way that they cannot return it. Beyond its physical benefits, badminton promotes mental alertness and teamwork.</p>"
